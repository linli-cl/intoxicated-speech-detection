Alcohol consumption causes numerous servere social, psychologial, and health problems including an increase in traffic accidents. Successful identification of alcohol consumption is crucial in addressing and preventing drinking and driving, as well as other safety and security issues. Using the Alcohol Language Corpus, the projectâ€™s task is designed as a binary classification between sober and drunk speech. This project attempts to use different feature kinds from raw speech and different machine learning/deep learning models to detect intoxicated speech. For each model, diverse techniques are applied such as oversampling, permutation importance for random forest, focal loss for convolutional neural network, memory-efficient tricks for pretrained model to achieve the best performance.
